Generating data
------------------

This is setting up a random " rnorm" 10 x 4 matrix:
```{r}
n  <- 10
B <- 4
x <- matrix(rnorm(n*B), nrow = n)
x
```


To assign names to the rows and columns:
```{r}
rownames(x)  <- sprintf("obs%02d", 1:n)
colnames(x)  <- sprintf("samp%02d", 1:B)
x
```

To make plots you can use very easy commands: 

```{r}
colMeans(x)
plot(colMeans(x))
```

If you use the #1 it refers to row, #2 column:
```{r}
h <- apply(x, 1, mean)
```

Here is another scatter plot of the means of the rows:
```{r}
plot(h)
```
